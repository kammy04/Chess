## Problem Definition

Chess is a universally loved game, renowned for its ability to stimulate critical thinking and strategy. However, many chess platforms either lack robust gameplay features or fail to provide a user-friendly interface for learning and practice.

This project aims to:

- Provide a seamless platform for playing chess with an intuitive and responsive design.
- Offer robust implementation of chess logic, including piece movements, legal moves, and game-end conditions.
- Lay the groundwork for future expansions, such as AI opponents or multiplayer capabilities.

## Game Features

### 1. **Game Mechanics**
- Implements all chess rules, including piece movements, castling, en passant, and checkmate detection.
- Real-time validation of legal moves to guide players and prevent invalid moves.

### 2. **Interactive User Interface**
- Designed with a clear, visually appealing layout for the chessboard and pieces.
- Responsive interactions to ensure smooth gameplay and feedback for user actions.

### 3. **Game State Management**
- Maintains an accurate record of the game state, including player turns and move history.
- Supports game resets and restarts.
